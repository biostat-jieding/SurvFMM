An R package for **parameter estimation** and **model checking** in the *finite mixture of censored models*.

***The key tasks include***: 
- Fit a mixture of nonparametric heteroscedastic censored regression models.
- Test the goodness-of-fit for a mixture of nonparametric heteroscedastic censored regression models.

We are still in preparing this R package. Please wait patiently ...

Thank you for your attention!
